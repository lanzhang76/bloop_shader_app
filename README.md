## What is Bloop?
"Bloop" is a multi-user online coding environment for collaboratively making GLSL shaders on a blob!! geometry, made with [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## How to use it?
It's pretty simple! Coders enter the room, edit the shader code, and share it with everyone in the room!

<br>Some benefits:
- <b>Preview</b>: Compile and Preview your shader code locally
- <b>Push</b>: Push/Upload your code to the server
- <b>Force Push</b>: Force push your code to everyone's screen (instantly overwrites others' canvases)
- <b>Pull</b>: Pull the latest update from the server
- <b>Get Random</b>: Get some inspiration by getting a random shader sketch from bloop library
